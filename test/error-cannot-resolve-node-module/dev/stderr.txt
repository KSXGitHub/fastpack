Module resolution error: cannot resolve 'url'
/.../test/error-cannot-resolve-node-module/index.js
This looks like base node.js library and unlikely is required in the browser environment.
If you still want to use it, first install the browser implementation with:

		npm install --save url

And then add this command line option when running fpack:

		--mock url:url

Module resolution error: cannot resolve 'dns'
/.../test/error-cannot-resolve-node-module/index2.js
This looks like base node.js library which does not have any browser implementation we are aware of
